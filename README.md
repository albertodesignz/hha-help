# Home Health Aide Checklist Dashboard

## Project Overview
This is a single-page web application that provides an interactive dashboard for tracking home health aide tasks. The application uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript with localStorage for data persistence.

## Features
- Tab-based navigation between different task categories (Do ASAP, Short-Term Actions, Long-Term Follow-up)
- Status tracking for each task using radio buttons (Not Started, Contacted, Process Started, Waiting for Response, Done)
- Progress dashboard showing overall completion statistics
- Interactive status filtering to view tasks by completion status with timestamps
- Notes system with timestamps for each task
- Data persistence using localStorage
- Reset functionality to clear all saved progress
- Mobile-responsive design optimized for Android devices

## Architecture
The application follows a simple structure:
- HTML for content structure and UI elements
- CSS for styling with media queries for responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity and localStorage integration

### Key Components
1. **Task Tracking System**: Each task has a unique ID and radio buttons for status tracking
2. **Notes System**: Collapsible notes section for each task with timestamp and delete functionality
3. **localStorage Integration**: Task statuses and notes are saved to and loaded from localStorage
4. **Dashboard Summary**: Displays counts of tasks in different statuses and overall progress
5. **Task Filtering System**: Click on status counters to view filtered lists of tasks by status
6. **Tab Navigation**: Responsive tab system that adjusts for mobile screens
7. **Responsive Design**: Media queries ensure proper display on mobile devices

## Development Notes
- The application runs entirely in the browser with no server dependencies
- Data is stored locally in the user's browser using localStorage
- Any changes or additions to tasks should include unique data-task-id attributes
- New task categories should be added as new tabs and tab-content elements
- Notes are stored as JSON objects with timestamp, ID, and text content
